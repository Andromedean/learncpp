compile, compiling, compilation
$g++ -o <compiled_name> <.cpp>
-ggdb     //when debugging
-DNDEBUG  // to define ndebug got release builds
-pedantic-errors  // disable compiler extensions
-Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion  // max warnings
-Werror  // treat warnings as errors
-std=c++11, -std=c++14, -std=c++17, or -std=c++20  // select version

variable initialization
int a; // no initializer (default initialization)
int b = 5; // initializer after equals sign (copy initialization)
int c( 6 ); // initializer in parenthesis (direct initialization)
// List initialization methods (C++11) (preferred)
int d { 7 }; // initializer in braces (direct list initialization)
int e = { 8 }; // initializer in braces after equals sign (copy list initialization)
int f {}; // initializer is empty braces (value initialization)
[[maybe_unused]] int x { 5 };  // prevents unused var warning

main()
returns status code/exit code
EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE

unnamed parameter
When a function parameter exists but is not used in the body of the function, do not give it a name
You can optionally put a name inside a comment though
void doSomething(int /*count*/)

The one definition rule (or ODR for short) is a well-known rule in C++. The ODR has three parts:
1 Within a given file, a function, variable, type, or template can only have one definition.
2 Within a given program, a variable or normal function can only have one definition. This distinction is
  made because programs can have more than one file.
3 Types, templates, inline functions, and inline variables are allowed to have identical definitions in different files
if declared
  if defined in same file: compiler connects
  else                   : linker connects

global namespace
any name not in a class, function or namespace
using:  i: <namespace>::<ider>
        ii: using namespace <namespace>; ...<ider>...;

conditional compilation
#define <ID_NAME>
#ifdef/#ifndef <ID_NAME>   ||  #if <0/1>
...
#endif
if fails, code inside is not compiled

preprocessor directives
don't cause text substitution in each other, only normal code
resolved top to bottom and file by file

header files: .h, .hpp, no extension
preferable place for documentation
i:  header guard: TODO
ii: declarations
#include <file in include dirs>
         || "search pwd first"
add additional include path: $g++ -I/source/includes
include order
  paired header file
  other ehaders from your project
  3rd party library headers
  standard library headers
sort alphabetically unless documentution tells differently
header guard, include guard
  #ifndef SOME_UNIQUE_NAME
  #define SOME_UNIQUE_NAME
  // declarations and certain definitions
  #endif
  unique name: <PROJECT><PATH><FILE>H
#pragma once
  not officially part of c++ and can fail but is generally accpepted in modern c++

assert
#include <cassert>
assert(<boolean <~&& "message">>);
  boolean may &&ed with a string since string literals evaluate to true to include with
If the conditional expression evaluates to false, an error message is displayed and the program is terminated (via std::abort)
This error message typically contains the expression that failed as text, along with the name of the code file and the line number of the assertion
Use to document cases that should be logically impossible
  Sometimes used as standins for unimplemented cases
~ should not appear in prod code:
    if NDEBUG is defined, asserts will not be compiled in
abort() function terminates the program immediately, without a chance to do any further cleanup (e.g. close a file or database)
Because of this, asserts should be used only in cases where corruption isn’t likely to occur if the program terminates unexpectedly

static assert
keyword so no include needed
static_assert(<condition>, <~diagnostic_message>)
eg: static_assert(sizeof(long) == 8, "long must be 8 bytes");
checked at compile-time: failing causes compilation to fail
  condition must be a constant expression
can be placed anywhere in the code file (even in the global namespace)
not compiled out in release builds (regardless of NDEBUG being defined?)

implicit, automatic type conversion, coercion
done by the compiler
  eg: double d{ 3 }; // int value 3 implicitly converted to type double
brace initialization disallows conversion with loss
  eg: int x { 3.5 }; // brace-initialization disallows conversions that result in data loss

numeric promotion
the type conversion of certain narrower numeric types (such as a char)
to certain wider numeric types (typically int or double)
that can be processed efficiently and is less likely to have a result that overflows
All numeric promotions are value-preserving, which means that the converted value will always
be equal to the source value (it will just have a different type)
Since all values of the source type can be precisely represented in the destination type,
value-preserving conversions are said to be “safe conversions”
may not preserve signedness of the type
float to double
bool, char, signed char, unsigned char, signed short, and unsigned short
all get promoted to int

numeric conversion
additional type conversions between fundamental types
basic types
i: an integral type to any other integral type (excluding integral promotions)
ii: Converting a floating point type to any other floating point type (excluding floating point promotions)
iii: Converting a floating point type to any integral type
iv: Converting an integral type to any floating point type
v: Converting an integral type or a floating point type to a bool
safety categories
i: Value-preserving conversions are safe numeric conversions where the destination type can
precisely represent all the values in the source type
can be converted back without loss
	int to double
ii: Reinterpretive conversions are potentially unsafe numeric conversions where the result may be outside the range of the source type. Signed/unsigned conversions fall into this category
Values converted using a reinterpretive conversion can be converted back to the source type, resulting in a value equivalent to the original value (even if the initial conversion produced a value out of range of the source type)
	signed int to unsigned int
iii: Lossy conversions are potentially unsafe numeric conversions where some data may be lost during the conversion
	double to float
Remember that overflow is well-defined for unsigned values and produces undefined behavior for signed values

narrowing conversion
disallowed with list initialization
use explicit cast
if value is constexpr and fits in narrower type, will convert and compile
	float types will convert if in range even if precision will be lost; may get compiler warning

arithmetic conversion
require their operands to be of the same type:
	The binary arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
	The binary relational operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
	The binary bitwise arithmetic operators: &, ^, |
	The conditional operator ?: (excluding the condition, which is expected to be of type bool)
The compiler has a ranked list of types that looks something like this:
long double (highest rank)
double
float
long long
long
int (lowest rank)
The following rules are applied to find a matching type:
	If one operand is an integral type and the other a floating point type, the integral operand is converted to the type of the floating point operand (no integral promotion takes place).
	Otherwise, any integral operands are numerically promoted
		If one operand is signed and the other unsigned, special rules apply:
			If the rank of the unsigned operand is greater than the rank of the signed operand, the signed operand is converted to the type of the unsigned operand.
			If the type of the signed operand can represent all the values of the type of the unsigned operand, the type of the unsigned operand is converted to the type of the signed operand.
			Otherwise both operands are converted to the corresponding unsigned type of the signed operand.
		Otherwise, the operand with lower rank is converted to the type of the operand with higher rank.
~signed ints get converted to unsigned so unintuitive behavior occurs 

casting
C++ supports 5 different types of casts:
C-style casts, static casts, const casts, dynamic casts, and reinterpret casts
the latter four are sometimes referred to as named casts
avoid const and reinterpret
c-style casting
	(<type>)x
	<type>(x)
	may inadvertently static cast, reinterpret cast or const cast
	avoid
static casting
	static_cast<<type>>(x)
	less powerful than c style eg: can't strip const

type alias 
using <alias> = <type>;
Use type aliases judiciously, when they provide a clear benefit to code readability or code maintenance
may be templated
alias convention that will be seen: _t and _type suffixes
alias convention to use: <Alias> capitalize first letter, no suffix
are not type safe so avoid mixing 
typedef
	typedef <type> <alias>
	use type alias instead
usecase
i:
consistent types for cross platform dev
#ifdef INT_2_BYTES
using int8_t = char;
using int16_t = int;
using int32_t = long;
#else
using int8_t = char;
using int16_t = short;
using int32_t = int;
#endif
ii:
using VectPairSI = std::vector<std::pair<std::string, int>>;

type deduction, type inference, auto
use auto keyword to deduce type when initializer is not empty and not void/incomplete
eg: auto a { 3 };   auto b { 9u };
modern consensus is that type deduction is generally safe to use for objects, and that doing so can help make your code more readable
Use type deduction for your variables when the type of the object doesn’t matter
drops cost/constexpr
eg: const int x { 5 };  // x has type const int (compile-time const)
	  auto y { x };       // y will be type int (const is dropped)
	  constexpr auto z { x }; // z will be type constexpr int (constexpr is reapplied)
string literals deduce to char* unless suffixed with s,sv
may use as return type for functions; will not be able to forward declare
auto foo() {}
trailing return syntax
auto foo() -> <type>;

function overloading
Functions can be overloaded so long as each overloaded function can be differentiated by the compiler
	parameter type, parameter count
	return type cannot be used to differentiate
for member functions, may differentiate with const or volatile and ref-qualifiers
compilers "mangle" (rename) the names of overloaded functions under the hood
overload resolution - matching to the correct function
	steps
		1: look for an exact match or one with trivial conversions (non const to const, non reference to reference or vice versa)
		2: numeric promotion and check match
		3: numeric conversion and check match
		4: try user defined conversions ("operator", constructors)
		5: match ellipsis
		6: compilation error
ambiguous matches: scenarios such as when one data type can be converted to two different types which both have overloads
	all conversions are equal: 0 will be ambiguous with float and unsigned int. so will 3.141
	to resolve: make new overload, cast argument, or suffix argument
for multiple parameters: a function is only chosen if it matches at least one argument better than any other
deleting functions: disallows a function to be used
	<return type> foo(<type>) = delete;
	if selected in matching, gives compilation error
	still will be able to cause ambiguous match
delete all non matching overloads
	// This function template will take precedence for arguments of other types
	template <typename T>
	void printInt(T x) = delete;

default arguments
type foo(arg a, arg b = x);
default argument parameters must be to the right of non default parameters
default parameters cannot be skipped (foo(arg a = x, arg b = y); foo(,z); // invalid)
	place default argument parameters most likely to be given arguments leftmost
cannot place default argument in multiple declarations/definitions: place in header declaration

templates
template \<<typensame/class> T\> // template parameter declaration
the following function or class template may use T as a type
eg: template <typename T>
		T max(T x, T y) {return (x < y) ? y : x;}
allows the compiler to generate a family of related functions or classes each with a different set of types
function templates
use type template parameters or template types for return type, parameter type or types used in the body
three types of template parameters
1: Type template parameters (where the template parameter represents a type)
2: Non-type template parameters (where the template parameter represents a constexpr value)
3: Template template parameters (where the template parameter represents a template)
template naming convention: T if obvious else Name or TName
